# validators

By convention, we drop ad-hoc validators that are executed for every file produced by a stage.

* Every validation script receives a single file path.
* Validators are droped at `STAGE/OUTPUT_NAME`.
* Use as few dependencies as possible. Benchmarker adds them to the `validation` pixi environment in `pixi.toml'
